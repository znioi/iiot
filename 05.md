# Experiment No. 5  
## Title  
(a) Measuring Light using LDR (Photoresistor)  
(b) Reading & Writing Digital and Analog Values in Arduino  

---

## Aim  
1️⃣ To measure light intensity using an LDR with Arduino by reading analog voltage values.  
2️⃣ To demonstrate digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogRead, and analogWrite operations in Arduino.

---

## Theory  
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is a passive electronic component whose resistance decreases when light intensity increases. When placed in a voltage divider network with a fixed resistor, a variable analog voltage is produced at their junction.  
Arduino contains a **10-bit ADC** which converts analog input (0–5V) into **digital values 0–1023**. Based on the amount of light falling on LDR, Arduino reads different values and controls output devices like LEDs.

Example behavior:  
| Light Intensity | LDR Resistance | Analog Reading |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Bright Light | Low resistance | High value (800–1023) |
| Dark | High resistance | Low value (0–400) |

LDR connections:
- **AO pin** → Analog input A0 of Arduino  
- **Voltage divider** formed using 10k resistor + LDR  
- LED used as output controlled by analog threshold  

---

## Circuit Explanation  
- Connect LDR and 10k resistor in voltage divider between 5V and GND  
- Junction goes to **A0**  
- LED_BUILTIN (pin 13) is used as indicator  
- Bright light → LED OFF  
- Dark → LED ON  

---

## Arduino Code
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(sensorValue); // for testing in Serial Monitor

  if (sensorValue > 700) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  }
  delay(10);
}
````

## Result

The LED glows when the LDR detects darkness or low light conditions and turns OFF in bright light. The Serial Monitor displays analog readings showing real-time light measurements.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is an LDR?**

* Light Dependent Resistor.
* Resistance decreases when light increases.
* Used to sense brightness in automation systems.

2️⃣ **Why use a voltage divider with LDR?**

* Because LDR outputs resistance change, not voltage.
* Voltage divider converts resistance variation into measurable voltage.
* Arduino reads voltage → converts to digital value.

3️⃣ **What is analogRead()?**

* Reads voltage from analog pins A0–A5.
* Converts 0–5V into 0–1023 using 10-bit ADC.
* Used for sensor signals.

4️⃣ **What is digitalWrite()?**

* Sets a digital pin HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V).
* Used to control LED, relays, etc.
* Only works on OUTPUT configured pins.

5️⃣ **What is ADC?**

* Analog to Digital Converter.
* Converts continuous analog voltage into discrete digital number.
* Arduino UNO uses a 10-bit ADC.

6️⃣ **Range of analog values in Arduino?**

* 0 to 1023.
* Represents 0 to 5V analog voltage.
* Helps precise measurement.

7️⃣ **How does Arduino measure light intensity?**

* LDR voltage changes with light.
* Arduino reads it through analogRead().
* Code decides ON/OFF based on threshold.

8️⃣ **Why do we set threshold value like 700?**

* To differentiate bright and dark environments.
* Calibration based on surroundings.
* Depends on sensor value in lighting environment.

9️⃣ **What happens if sensor is covered completely?**

* Analog value drops low (dark).

21️⃣ **Define Lux.**

* Unit of illumination measurement.
* LDR indirectly relates to lux.
* Higher lux → higher analog reading.

22️⃣ **What is PWM?**

* Pulse Width Modulation.
* Controls brightness/speed like analog effect.

23️⃣ **Why delay is needed?**

* Allows stable reading.
* Avoids too-fast flickering.
* Human eye can perceive change.

24️⃣ **What happens if threshold too low?**

* LED remains ON even in light.
* False triggering increases.
* Calibration needed.

25️⃣ **What happens if threshold too high?**

* LED rarely turns ON.
* Very sensitive to bright light only.
* Again calibration required.

26️⃣ **What is Photoconductivity?**
