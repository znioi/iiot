## Title  
Control Structure Programming using if-else, for loop and while / do-while loops in Arduino  

---

## Aim  
To understand and implement different control structures (if-else, for, while, do-while) in Arduino programming using LED control.

---

## Theory  
Control structures define the flow of program execution based on conditions, loops, and decisions.  
It helps automate tasks such as LED blinking, reading sensors, controlling output actions, and making decisions based on real-time data.  

Types of Control Structures in Arduino:  
| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Conditional | Execute code only when condition is TRUE | if, if-else, switch-case |
| Looping | Repeated execution | for, while, do-while |
| Jump | Change normal flow | break, continue, return, goto |

Key Control Structures:  
- **if / else** → decision-making based on condition  
- **for loop** → known repetition (counting loops)  
- **while loop** → repeat as long as condition TRUE  
- **do-while** → execute once then check condition  

These are similar to the C language, making Arduino easy for beginners with C/C++ knowledge.

| LED | 1 |
| 10kΩ Resistor | 1 |
| Breadboard | 1 |
| Jumper Wires | Few |

## Circuit Diagram Description  
- LED positive terminal → Pin 13  
- LED negative terminal → Resistor → GND  
- A0 pin used as sensor input in conditional programs

## Experiment 1 — For Loop (LED Fading)
```cpp
int LEDpin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  for(int value = 0; value <= 255; value++) {
    analogWrite(LEDpin, value);
    delay(30);
  }
  delay(50);

  for(int value = 255; value >= 0; value--) {
    analogWrite(LEDpin, value);
    delay(30);
  }
  delay(50);
}
````

---

## Experiment 2 — If-Else (Sensor Input)

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  if (sensorValue > 700) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  }
  delay(10);
}
```

---

## Experiment 3 — Do-While Loop (Conditional LED Blinking)

```cpp
int sensorPin = A0;
int LEDpin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  do {
    digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
  while (analogRead(sensorPin) > 700);
}
```

---

## Result

The LED brightness changes using for loop, LED turns ON/OFF based on analog sensor value using if-else, and LED blinks as long as condition remains TRUE in do-while loop.
This verifies the working of control structures in embedded programs.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is a control structure?**

* A feature that controls flow of execution in a program.
* Ensures decisions and repetitions are automated.
* Essential for interactive embedded behavior.

2️⃣ **What is an if statement?**

* Executes code when a condition is TRUE.
* Used for real-time decision making.
* Example: Turn ON LED if value > threshold.

3️⃣ **Explain if-else with example.**

* if runs when TRUE, else executes when FALSE.
* Provides two-way decision output.
* Useful for ON/OFF automation.

4️⃣ **What is a for loop?**

* Loop that executes a known number of times.
* Ideal for counting and repetitive tasks.
* Used in LED fading from 0–255.

5️⃣ **Structure of a for loop.**

* for(initialization; condition; increment)
* Automates counting and repetition.
* Stops when condition becomes FALSE.

6️⃣ **What is while loop?**

* Repeats code while condition remains TRUE.
* Checks condition before entering loop.
* LED blinks continuously until switch pressed.

7️⃣ **Difference between while and do-while.**

* while checks condition first.
* do-while executes once before checking condition.
* Used when at least one execution is required.

8️⃣ **What is analogRead()?**

* Reads sensor value between 0–1023.
