# Experiment No. 3(B)
## Title  
Study of Functions in Arduino Programming

---

## Aim  
To understand the concept of built-in and user-defined functions in Arduino and implement them in a program.

---

## Theory  
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in modular programming, reduce code repetition, and improve readability.  

There are two types of functions in Arduino:
1. **Built-in Functions** – Provided by Arduino (e.g., pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay(), Serial.print())  
2. **User-Defined Functions** – Created by the programmer to perform repeated tasks  

Standard Function Structure:
```cpp
return_type functionName(parameters) {
   // Code statements
   return value;  // optional
}
````

Every Arduino sketch must contain:

* `setup()` → Runs only once
* `loop()` → Runs continuously

## Components Required

| Item        | Quantity  |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Arduino UNO | 1         |
| USB Cable   | 1         |
| Arduino IDE | Installed |

---

## Code Example 1: Using Built-in Functions

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
  Serial.println("LED ON");
  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  Serial.println("LED OFF");
  delay(1000);
}
```

---

## Code Example 2: Using a User-Defined Function

```cpp
int led = 9;

void blinkLED(int timeDelay) {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  delay(timeDelay);
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  delay(timeDelay);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  blinkLED(500); // Calling user-defined function
}
```

---

## Result

The LED blinks at a constant interval repeatedly by calling the custom function. This demonstrates the use of both built-in and user-defined functions in Arduino programming.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is a function?**

* A reusable block of code that performs a particular task.
* Prevents code repetition and improves readability.
* Essential for logic structuring.

2️⃣ **What are built-in functions?**

* Predefined functions in Arduino library.
* Example: pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay().
* Easy access to hardware control.

3️⃣ **What are user-defined functions?**

* Functions created by the programmer.
* Used when specific repeated operation needed.
* Increases modularity of code.

4️⃣ **Why are functions important?**

* Reduce complexity by breaking large programs into small tasks.
* Improves debugging and maintenance.
* Saves time by reusing code.

5️⃣ **Syntax of a function in Arduino?**

* `return_type functionName(parameters) { body }`
* Must follow brackets and naming rules.
* Parameters optional based on requirement.

6️⃣ **Explain return type in functions.**

* Defines what value function gives back.
* Example: int, float, bool, void.
* void means no returning value.

7️⃣ **What is a parameter?**

* Values passed into a function.
* Used inside function for operations.
* Helps make flexible & dynamic functions.

8️⃣ **Difference between function declaration and definition?**

* Declaration tells compiler about function name & type.
* Definition contains complete working code.
* Sometimes both done together.

9️⃣ **Can loop() be considered a function?**

* Yes, a special Arduino function.
* Repeats endlessly after setup.
* Used for main running logic.

🔟 **What is setup() function?**

* Initializes system components.
* Runs only once on power or reset.
* Used for pinMode, Serial.begin etc.

1️⃣1️⃣ **What is meant by scope of a variable?**

* Region where variable is accessible.
* Local: inside function only.
* Global: used anywhere in the program.

1️⃣2️⃣ **Why do we use void keyword?**

* Indicates the function returns nothing.
* Common for functions that only execute tasks.
* Saves memory by avoiding data return.

1️⃣3️⃣ **What is function calling?**

* Invoking a function to run its code.
* Must match function name and parameters.
* Without calling, definition is ignored.

1️⃣4️⃣ **Can a function call another function?**

* Yes, called nested functions.
* Used in layered or complex systems.
* Better structural organization.

1️⃣5️⃣ **What is recursion?**

* Function calling itself again.
* Used in data structures & algorithms.
* Rarely used in Arduino due to memory limits.

1️⃣6️⃣ **What is default return value if none specified?**

* Compiler throws an error if non-void function lacks return.
* Void functions do not return anything.
* Return type must match usage.

1️⃣7️⃣ **What is Serial.print()?**

* Built-in communication function.
* Displays output on Serial Monitor.
* Very helpful for debugging.

1️⃣8️⃣ **What is the use of delay() function?**

* Pauses execution for specified milliseconds.
* Helps create timing-based behavior.
* Blocks further code execution temporarily.

1️⃣9️⃣ **Can we define a function without parameters?**

* Yes. Example: setup() or loop().
* Executes same task every time called.
* Parameter add flexibility but not mandatory.

2️⃣0️⃣ **Can functions return multiple values?**

* Directly NO.
* Can return array, structure, or modify global variables.
* Only one return type allowed.

2️⃣1️⃣ **Why is naming of functions important?**

* Should represent task clearly.
* Increases code readability.
* Avoid reserved keywords.

2️⃣2️⃣ **What happens if we forget braces in function?**

* Syntax error during compilation.
* Functions require `{ }` to define code block.
* Braces structure execution flow.

2️⃣3️⃣ **Do Arduino functions support overloading?**

* Yes. Same name, different parameters.
* Helps create flexible usage with same name.
* C++ feature supported in Arduino.

2️⃣4️⃣ **Explain function prototype.**

* Pre-declaration of function before usage.
* Helps when definition exists later in file.
* Required when calling before defining.

2️⃣5️⃣ **What are return statements used for?**

* Sends value back to calling location.
* Also stops function execution.
* Used in computations or decisions.

2️⃣6️⃣ **Is setup() and loop() user-defined?**

* Defined by programmer but required by Arduino structure.
* They must exist in every sketch.
* Special meaning for microcontroller.

2️⃣7️⃣ **Can we use same variable name in different functions?**

* Yes, if declared locally.
* Local variables live inside their function only.
* No conflict in different scopes.

2️⃣8️⃣ **Why avoid long functions in code?**

* Harder to debug & understand.
* Increases memory space.
* Functions must be short & task-oriented.

2️⃣9️⃣ **Can a function modify a global variable?**

* Yes, globals accessible anywhere.
* Useful but can cause errors if misused.
* Must be careful with global-based logic.

3️⃣0️⃣ **What is modular programming?**

* Breaking program into small manageable units.
* Functions make code readable & reusable.
* Standard practice in embedded & IoT systems.
