exp 5:
1) design a system that turns on an led automatically when the light inrensity increase via LDR falls below the threshold and turn off when intensity is high.
---------
2) create a system that measures light intensity in a classroom and adjust the brightness of LED's to maintain a constant level for reading
-----
3) led brightness control with potentiometer (use a potentiometer as a input to control a brightness of a led via pvm analog right pin)
