# Experiment No. 9  
## Title  
Servo Motor Working and Programming with Arduino

---

## Aim  
To interface a servo motor with Arduino UNO and control its angular position using the Servo library and PWM signals.

---

## Theory  
A servo motor is a closed-loop actuator consisting of a DC motor, gear system, and a positional feedback sensor (potentiometer). It receives control signals that determine the desired shaft angle (0°–180° typically).  
Arduino controls servo position using **PWM signal** on the signal pin. Servo continuously checks the pulse width and rotates to the correct angle.

Servo PWM signal mapping:  
| Pulse Width | Angle |
|-------------|-------|
| 1 ms | ~0° |
| 1.5 ms | ~90° |
| 2 ms | ~180° |

Servo Motor Wires:  
| Wire Color | Function | Connects To |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Red | VCC | 5V |
| Brown/Black | GND | GND |
| Yellow/Orange | Signal | PWM pin (D9) |

Applications: Robotics, antennas, camera gimbals, robotic arms & automation.

## Components Required  
| Component | Quantity |
|----------|----------|
| Servo Motor (SG90) | 1 |
| Arduino UNO | 1 |
| Jumper wires | Few |
| Power supply (USB) | 1 |

## Circuit Description  
- Servo **VCC → 5V**  
- Servo **GND → GND**  
- Servo **Signal → Pin 9** (PWM pin)  

⚠️ Note: When using multiple servos, external 5V supply is recommended.

## Code 1 — Sweep Servo (0°→180°→0°)
```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // Servo signal pin connected to 9
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
}
````

## Code 2 — Serial Controlled Servo Position

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  myservo.attach(9);
}

void loop() {
  int val;
  while (Serial.available() > 0) {
    val = Serial.parseInt();
    if (val >= 0 && val <= 180) {
      Serial.print("Moving to: ");
      Serial.println(val);
      myservo.write(val);
      delay(15);
    }
  }
}
```

22️⃣ **Why are gears present inside servo?**

* Increase torque at shaft.
* Control precise low-speed rotation.
* Ensures stable output motion.

23️⃣ **What is servo backlash?**

* Small free movement at shaft before engagement.

25️⃣ **Why do we detach servo sometimes?**

* myservo.detach() disables pin.
* Saves power once goal position reached.
* Avoids jitter.
