## Theory  
Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on a microcontroller. It can take inputs like button press, light, motion, etc., and convert them into meaningful actions such as glowing an LED, controlling motors, sending serial data, etc. It can be programmed using Arduino IDE where programs are written in the form of sketches (.ino files).  
It consists of components like USB interface, input/output pins (digital, analog), voltage regulator, IC (ATmega series), and reset button.
