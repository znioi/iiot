## Title
Blinking LED and Fading LED using PWM in Arduino

---

## Aim
To write and execute Arduino programs for blinking an LED and varying its brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

---

---

## Theory  
An LED (Light Emitting Diode) glows when a certain amount of current flows through it in forward direction. We control LEDs using Arduino by sending HIGH or LOW signals through digital pins.  
To vary brightness, Arduino uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), where a digital pin switches between HIGH and LOW quickly. The average ON time (duty cycle) controls brightness. PWM is useful for applications like light dimming, motor speed control, and audio generation.  

Key functions used:  
- `pinMode(pin, OUTPUT)` → defines output pin  
- `digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW)` → LED ON/OFF  
- `analogWrite(pin, value)` → PWM brightness control (0–255)  
- `delay(ms)` → creates time interval

## Components Required
| Component | Quantity |
|----------|----------|
| Arduino UNO | 1 |
| Breadboard | 1 |
| LED | 1 |
| 220Ω Resistor | 1 |
| Jumper Wires | 2 |

## Circuit Explanation
- LED positive (long leg) is connected to Arduino digital pin.
- LED negative (short leg) is connected to GND through a 220Ω resistor.
- For PWM fading, we use PWM-capable pins (~ symbol) like D9.
- Arduino controls LED blinking and brightness using digitalWrite() and analogWrite() functions.

## Arduino Code 1: Blinking LED
```cpp
/*
   Blink LED
   Turns LED ON for one second and OFF for one second repeatedly.
*/
void setup() {
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 8 as OUTPUT
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // Turn ON
  delay(1000);           // 1 second delay
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // Turn OFF
  delay(1000);
}
````

## Arduino Code 2: LED Fading using PWM

```cpp
int ledPin = 9; // PWM pin
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  for(int fade = 0; fade <= 255; fade += 5){
    analogWrite(ledPin, fade); // increase brightness gradually
    delay(30);
  }
  for(int fade = 255; fade >= 0; fade -= 5){
    analogWrite(ledPin, fade); // decrease brightness gradually
    delay(30);
  }
}
```

---

## Result

The LED successfully blinks at a fixed rate and its brightness smoothly fades IN and OUT using PWM. This confirms the concept of digital output and analog-like PWM.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is the purpose of pinMode() function?**

* pinMode() defines whether a pin is used as INPUT or OUTPUT.
* It helps the microcontroller know the direction of data.
* Without this, digitalWrite/digitalRead may not work correctly.

2️⃣ **Why do we use a resistor with LED?**

* To limit current flowing through LED.
* Prevents LED from burning due to excessive current.
* Also protects microcontroller pin from overcurrent damage.

3️⃣ **What is the purpose of digitalWrite()?**

* Sets a digital pin HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V).
* Used to control digital devices like LED.
* Forms basic ON/OFF control mechanism.

4️⃣ **What is the delay() function used for?**

* Pauses program execution for given milliseconds.
* Creates visible blinking effect.
* Helps control speed of LED transitions.

5️⃣ **What is PWM?**

* PWM = Pulse Width Modulation.
* Digital signal mimics analog output by varying ON/OFF time.
* Used for brightness control and motor speed control.

6️⃣ **Which pins in Arduino UNO support PWM?**

* Pins with ~ symbol: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11.
* They support analogWrite() function.
* Can generate variable duty cycle.

7️⃣ **What is the duty cycle in PWM?**

* Percentage of HIGH time in one cycle.
* Higher duty cycle = more brightness/speed.
