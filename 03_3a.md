## Title  
Understanding Arduino IDE, Basic Structure of a Sketch & Operators in Arduino Programming

---

## Aim  
To understand the Arduino IDE environment, write a basic Arduino sketch, and learn different operators used in Arduino programming.

---

## Theory  
Arduino IDE is the platform used for writing, verifying, and uploading programs (sketches) to Arduino boards. A basic sketch contains `setup()` (initialization code) and `loop()` (repeated execution).  
Operators are special symbols used to perform operations like arithmetic, logic, assignment, comparison, and increment/decrement within code. These are essential for decision making and performing calculations in embedded programs.

Types of Operators in Arduino:  
| Type | Examples | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Arithmetic | +, -, \*, /, % | Math operations |
| Comparison | ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= | Logical comparison |
| Logical | &&, \|\|, ! | Decision making |
| Assignment | =, +=, -=, \*= | Updating a variable |
| Increment/Decrement | ++, -- | Value increase/decrease |
| Bitwise | &, \|, ^, <<, >> | Low-level register operations |

## Components Required  
| Item | Quantity |
|------|----------|
| Arduino UNO | 1 |
| USB Cable | 1 |
| Arduino IDE (Software) | Installed |

## Arduino Code Example (Operators Demonstration)
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
int result;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  result = a + b;
  Serial.print("Addition: ");
  Serial.println(result);

  result = a - b;
  Serial.print("Subtraction: ");
  Serial.println(result);

  result = a * b;
  Serial.print("Multiplication: ");
  Serial.println(result);

  result = a / b;
  Serial.print("Division: ");
  Serial.println(result);

  if (a > b) {
    Serial.println("a is greater than b");
  }

  a++;
  Serial.print("Incremented a: ");
  Serial.println(a);
}

void loop() {
}
````

## Output Observation

The Serial Monitor displays results of arithmetic operations and comparison between variables. Increment effect is also shown.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is Arduino IDE?**

* A software used to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino boards.
* Provides Serial Monitor to debug output.
* Free and open-source, supports library integration.

2️⃣ **What is a Sketch in Arduino?**

* A program written in Arduino IDE.
* Saved with `.ino` extension.
* Contains setup and loop functions.

3️⃣ **Explain setup() function.**

* Executes only once when system starts.
* Used for initialization: pinMode(), Serial.begin(), etc.
* Mandatory part of every Arduino sketch.

4️⃣ **Explain loop() function.**

* Repeats continuously after setup ends.
* Used to run main logic repeatedly.
* Makes embedded programs run automatically.

5️⃣ **What is Serial.begin()?**

* Initializes serial communication.
* Baud rate 9600 means 9600 bits/sec data speed.
* Needed to print data on Serial Monitor.

6️⃣ **Why is Serial Monitor used in experiments?**

* Helps view output and debug code.
* Shows sensor readings, logic results.
* Acts as communication interface with PC.

7️⃣ **What are operators?**

* Symbols used to perform calculations and decisions.
* Example: +, -, ==, &&, etc.
* Backbone of programming automation.

8️⃣ **What are arithmetic operators?**

* Used to add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers.
* Useful for mathematical calculations.
* Essential in sensor data processing.

9️⃣ **Explain comparison operators.**

* Used to compare two values (>, <, == etc).
* Returns TRUE or FALSE.
* Helpful in decisions like if-else.

10️⃣ **What are logical operators?**

* Used to combine conditions (&&, || and !).
* Helps in multi-condition decision making.
* Example: detect both button press & sensor condition.

11️⃣ **What is assignment operator?**

* Assigns value to variable (=).
* Also supports shorthand (+=, -=).
* Stores updated values in program.

12️⃣ **What is increment operator?**

* ++ increases value by 1 each time used.
* Useful in loops or counters.
* Saves time compared to a=a+1.

13️⃣ **What is decrement operator?**

* -- decreases value by 1.
* Used in countdown/loops.
* Helps reverse iterations.

14️⃣ **What are bitwise operators?**

* Operate on individual bits (&, |, <<, >>).
* Used in hardware register control.
* Important in memory-efficient embedded logic.

15️⃣ **What is the importance of variables in Arduino?**

* Stores data values like sensor readings.
* Can be modified and reused anytime.
* Core element of any logic.

16️⃣ **Explain integer data type.**

* Stores whole numbers (positive/negative).
* Example: int x = 10;
* Range: –32,768 to +32,767 (16-bit on UNO)

17️⃣ **What is a compiler?**

* Converts human code into machine instructions.
* In Arduino IDE, Verify button compiles code.
* Reports error messages if syntax wrong.

18️⃣ **What is baud rate?**

* Speed of serial data transfer.
* Transmitter + Receiver must match same rate.
* Common value: 9600 bps.

19️⃣ **Why do we initialize Serial inside setup()?**

* It only needs to start once.
* Keeps loop() clean from unnecessary repetition.
* Saves CPU cycles.

20️⃣ **What is debugging?**

* Finding & fixing errors in code.
* Serial Monitor helps validate logic.
* Essential for reliable output.

21️⃣ **What is syntax error?**

* Mistake in writing code format.
* Compiler stops execution.
* Example: Missing semicolon.

22️⃣ **Difference between = and == ?**

* "=" assigns value.
* "==" compares values.
* Very common beginner mistake.

23️⃣ **Why do we use comment lines in code?**

* Improves readability.
* Helps others understand program.
* Ignored by compiler.

24️⃣ **What is the purpose of Verify button?**

* Checks program for errors.
* Compiles without uploading.
* First step before Upload.

25️⃣ **What happens when Upload button is clicked?**

* Code first compiles.
* Then gets transferred to Arduino memory.
* Board restarts with updated program.

26️⃣ **What is real-time execution in Arduino?**

* Code runs continuously without user intervention.
* Sensors and outputs handled live.
* Embedded systems work in real-time.

27️⃣ **Why are operators necessary?**

* To perform calculations and decisions.
* Control system behavior dynamically.
* Used in every logical condition.

28️⃣ **Explain void keyword.**

* Indicates function returns no value.

* Common in final IoT deployments.

30️⃣ **What is case sensitivity in Arduino code?**

* Upper/lowercase letters treated differently.
* Example: Loop != loop != LOOP
* Must follow correct programming rules.
