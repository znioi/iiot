# Experiment No. 6  
## Title  
Temperature & Humidity Measurement using DHT Sensor (DHT11)

---

## Aim  
To interface a DHT11 sensor with Arduino UNO and measure real-time temperature and humidity values using digital output.

---

## Theory  
DHT11 is a low-cost digital environmental sensor capable of measuring **temperature** and **humidity** simultaneously. It has an internal **capacitive humidity sensor** and **NTC thermistor** for temperature.  
A built-in **8-bit microcontroller** processes sensor readings and sends calibrated digital output to Arduino.  

Key Features:  
| Parameter | DHT11 |
|----------|-------|
| Humidity Range | 20% – 90% RH |
| Temperature Range | 0°C – 50°C |
| Output Type | Digital signal |
| Accuracy | ±5% RH, ±2°C |

DHT11 Pin Description:  
| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| 1 | VCC (3.3V–5V) |
| 2 | DATA → Arduino pin 2 |
| 3 | NC (Not Connected) |
| 4 | GND |

DHT uses a **single-wire communication** protocol, so only one digital pin required.

## Components Required  
| Component | Qty |
|----------|-----|
| Arduino UNO | 1 |
| DHT11 Sensor | 1 |
| 10kΩ Resistor (Optional for pull-up) | 1 |
| Jumper Wires | Few |
| Breadboard | 1 |

## Circuit Description  
- DHT11 **VCC** → Arduino **5V**  
- DHT11 **DATA** → Arduino **D2**  
- DHT11 **GND** → Arduino **GND**  
- Optional 10k resistor between **DATA & VCC** (pull-up)

---

## Arduino Code for DHT11 (Final Correct Working Code)
```cpp
#include <DHT.h>

#define DHTPIN 2       // Sensor connected to pin 2
#define DHTTYPE DHT11  // Sensor Type DHT11

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("DHT11 Sensor Test");
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  delay(2000); // Sensor reading delay

  float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
  float temperature = dht.readTemperature();

  if (isnan(humidity) || isnan(temperature)) {
    Serial.println("Error Reading DHT11 Data!");
    return;
  }

  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(humidity);
  Serial.print("%  Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperature);
  Serial.println("°C");
}
````

## Output

The Serial Monitor displays real-time temperature in °C and humidity in %RH every 2 seconds.

---

## Result

The DHT11 sensor readings successfully display humidity and temperature values on the Serial Monitor, proving successful interfacing and measurement.

## Viva Questions & Answers (30 Detailed)

1️⃣ **What is DHT11?**

* A low-cost digital sensor for environment sensing.
* Measures temperature & humidity both.
* Uses internal MCU for calibrated digital output.

2️⃣ **Why DHT11 does not connect to analog pins?**

* It gives digital data, not analog voltage.
* Uses single-wire digital protocol.
* Therefore must connect to a **digital pin**.

3️⃣ **What is NTC thermistor?**

* Negative Temperature Coefficient device.
* Resistance decreases when temperature increases.
* Used for temperature sensing inside DHT11.

4️⃣ **What does capacitive humidity sensor do?**

* Detects dielectric change due to moisture.
* Measures relative humidity in environment.
* Converts it into digital output.

5️⃣ **What is the digital output resolution of DHT11?**

* Temperature: 1°C step change
* Humidity: 1% RH resolution
* Less precise than DHT22

6️⃣ **Why do we need delay(2000)?**

* DHT11 sampling rate: 1 reading per second only.
* Too frequent reading causes invalid values.
* Delay ensures stability.

7️⃣ **What is isnan()?**

* Function that checks if data is invalid (Not-a-Number).
* Used to detect sensor failure.
* Helps avoid printing wrong values.

8️⃣ **What library is needed for DHT11?**

* `<DHT.h>` from Adafruit.
* Offers functions: readTemperature(), readHumidity().
* Must be installed via Library Manager.

9️⃣ **Difference between DHT11 and DHT22?**

* DHT22 is more accurate & wider range.
* DHT11 is cheaper with limited sensing range.
* Both use same library.

10️⃣ **What is RH?**

* **Relative Humidity** measured in %.
* Amount of moisture in air compared to max capacity.
* Important in agriculture, weather, HVAC.

11️⃣ **Can DHT11 measure in Fahrenheit?**

* Yes using readTemperature(true).
* 'true' converts Celsius → Fahrenheit.
* Temperature format is selectable.

12️⃣ **What happens if wrong pin mode used?**

* Sensor communication fails.
* Serial Monitor prints error message.
* Correct pin and wiring required.

13️⃣ **Why optional pull-up resistor?**

* Keeps data line stable & noise free.
* Recommended for long wires.
* Ensures correct logic levels.

14️⃣ **What does Serial.begin(9600) do?**

* Starts UART serial communication at 9600 bps.
* Allows monitoring sensor values on PC.
* Baud rate must match Serial Monitor.

15️⃣ **Why sensor readings fluctuate?**

* Environmental variations.
* Sensor warm-up and airflow effects.
* DHT11 accuracy ±2°C, ±5% RH.

16️⃣ **What happens if sensor receives more than 5V?**

* Sensor gets permanently damaged.
* Only 3.3V–5V allowed.
* Always check pinout.

17️⃣ **Is DHT11 digital or analog sensor?**

* Digital communication only.
* Output values are numbers, not voltage.
* No need for analogRead().

* float gives precision.

23️⃣ **What will happen if delay removed?**

* Sensor fails to respond properly.
* Outputs NaN (invalid data).
* Must limit reading frequency.

24️⃣ **Why humidity measurement important?**

* Health & comfort control
* Helps avoid mold and dryness
* Crucial in food/medicine storage

25️⃣ **Why temperature measurement important?**
